## About Me

I build **backend systems that scale**—not just codebases that run. My engineering philosophy centers on clarity, security-first design, and understanding how software behaves under pressure. I think in abstractions, design in patterns, and code with purpose.

Currently: Studying Software Engineering | Building production-ready systems | Deepening expertise in distributed systems and secure architecture

Location: **Lima, Peru** 🇵🇪

## Engineering Philosophy

> *"Good software isn't about the language you use. It's about the decisions you make before you write a single line."*

My approach:

- **Architecture First**: Every system should have a clear mental model—separation of concerns, single responsibility, testability baked in
- **Security as Foundation**: Authentication, validation, and data protection aren't afterthoughts; they're architectural decisions
- **Systems Thinking**: Understanding the whole picture—how services communicate, how data flows, where bottlenecks emerge
- **Production Awareness**: Writing code I'd trust in a 24/7 system serving thousands of requests

---

## Technical Foundation

### Backend Engineering
```
Node.js + Express  →  Building RESTful APIs with structure
Python + FastAPI   →  High-performance async backends
PostgreSQL         →  Data modeling with integrity and performance
Docker            →  Consistent, reproducible environments
```

### Core Competencies
- **API Design**: RESTful principles, versioning, documentation
- **Authentication & Authorization**: JWT flows, role-based access control, token security
- **Database Architecture**: Schema design, query optimization, relational modeling
- **Error Handling**: Structured logging, meaningful responses, graceful degradation
- **Code Organization**: Clean architecture patterns, SOLID principles applied practically
- **Security Practices**: OWASP awareness, input validation, secure session management

## Notable Projects

### 🔐 **Secure Tasks API**
A backend service that demonstrates architectural maturity:
- JWT authentication with refresh token strategies
- Role-based endpoint protection (`admin`, `user`, `viewer`)
- Structured error handling with meaningful status codes
- Service-Controller-Route separation of concerns
- Input validation and comprehensive endpoint testing

*Why it matters*: Not just a feature list—it's a blueprint for how backends should be structured.

### 📦 **Inventory Management System**
Backend prototype showing systems-thinking approach:
- Atomic CRUD operations with transaction awareness
- Real-time data consistency handling
- Database schema optimized for typical query patterns
- Cost-aware deployment decisions (choosing appropriate cloud tier)

*Why it matters*: Every decision—from data structure to deployment—tied to business logic and constraints.

## What I'm Working Toward

Currently deepening expertise in:
- **Advanced PostgreSQL**: Query optimization, indexing strategies, understanding execution plans
- **System Design Interviews**: Scaling decisions, trade-off analysis, distributed systems patterns
- **Production Readiness**: Monitoring, logging, graceful failure handling
- **AI Integration**: Building systems that leverage AI models effectively (not just prompt chaining)

Next portfolio project: **Full-stack backend with integrated ML pipeline** demonstrating end-to-end system design thinking.

---

## How I Approach Problems

1. **Understand the constraints**: What are the non-functional requirements? Who are the users?
2. **Design the architecture**: Where does data flow? What are the critical paths?
3. **Implement deliberately**: Each decision is intentional—naming, structure, error handling
4. **Test rigorously**: Edge cases reveal design flaws
5. **Think operationally**: Will this work at 3 AM when something breaks?

---

## Learning & Growth

I'm intentionally building depth:
- Reading about distributed systems and consensus algorithms
- Understanding database internals—not just using them
- Studying security from first principles
- Analyzing production systems (publicly available architectures)

I believe in **depth over trend-following**.

## Let's Connect

I'm interested in:
- Backend engineering challenges
- System design discussions
- Security-focused roles
- Mentorship opportunities
