👨‍💻 Professional Synopsis

I am a Software Engineering student at SENATI and a PRONABEC Beca 18 scholar. My mission is to bridge the gap between high-performance backend systems and defensive cybersecurity. I don't just write code; I engineer resilient architectures that prioritize security by design, scalability, and maintainability.

🧠 Core Engineering Pillars

Defensive Security

Applied Intelligence

RESTful & GraphQL APIs

OWASP Top 10 Mitigation

LLM Implementation

Distributed Systems

Secure Auth (JWT/OAuth2)

Predictive Security Models

Microservices Architecture

Penetration Testing Concepts

Smart Automation Scripts

Database Optimization

Encryption & Hashing

Data-Driven Decisions
